## Quantum Information Processing

**Advances today (scientific):**
*   Certified randomness amplification is achieved across a 98-qubit quantum processor.\n*   Real-time quantum gates and millisecond measurement reveals limit classical spoofing.\n*   The system demonstrates amplification of imperfect randomness with a 4,500 km radius.

**Big picture (science communication):**
Researchers have demonstrated certified randomness amplification across a network using entangled quantum states. This novel approach, leveraging a 98-qubit quantum processor, mitigates bias in physical random number generators and limits potential adversarial influence to a 4,500 km radius. Why it matters: This breakthrough offers a fundamentally more secure and reliable source of randomness for critical applications like cryptography.

## Quantum Harmonic Oscillators Dynamics

**Advances today (scientific):**
*   Classical correlations decay linearly with misalignment, exhibiting fragility.\n*   Quantum correlations demonstrate robustness, decaying quadratically with misalignment.\n*   Experimental techniques allow for the observation and manipulation of quantum phases.

**Big picture (science communication):**
These papers explore the persistent presence of quantum correlations and entanglement in seemingly classical systems. Specifically, they demonstrate that frequency shifts in coupled oscillators, spinor gases, and system-environment correlations represent measurable signatures of non-classical behavior, despite the absence of directly observable quantum effects. The robustness of these correlations – quantified by their decay rate under measurement misalignment – dictates their utility as thermodynamic resources.  Crucially, the degree of nonlocality doesn't determine maximum energetic value, but operational robustness. Why it matters: Understanding these persistent quantum signatures offers new approaches to quantum-enhanced sensing and exploring fundamental questions about the quantum-to-classical boundary.
